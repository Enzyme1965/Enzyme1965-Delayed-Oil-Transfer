# E-Commerce Customer Segmentation and Analysis
---
### Project Overview
**Objectives**
The goal of this project is to analyze the customer behavior of an e-commerce platform and segment customers based on their purchasing patterns. By clustering customers into different segments, the project aims to provide valuable insights that can help improve targeted marketing, customer retention, and sales strategies

**Problem Statement**
The company wants to better understand its customer base to tailor marketing efforts and improve the customer experience. By segmenting customers into meaningful groups, we can personalize promotions and recommendations.

**Methodology**
+ **Data collection:** Data source, Data features.
+ **Data cleaning:** Remove duplicates, Handle missing values.
+ **Analysis:** Univariate analysis, Bivariate analysis, Customer demographics.
+ **Customer Segmentation using Clustering:** Clustering Techniques, Hierarchical Clustering.
+ **Cluster Analysis and Profiling:** Analysis of Clusters, Cluster Labels, Visual Representation.

**Data Source**
The data set was from an e-commerce platform, typically available from sources such as Kaggle.

**Tools and Technologies**
1. **Programming Languages:** Python (for data analysis and machine learning)
2. **Libraries:**
   + Pandas for data manipulation
   + NumPy for numerical calculations
   + Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
   + Scikit-learn for clustering and model evaluation
   + KMeans, AgglomerativeClustering for clustering
   + Plotly or Dash for interactive visualizations (if applicable)
3. **Jupyter Notebook:** for analysis and presentation

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
1. Univariate Analysis:
+ Visualize the distribution of key features (TotalPurchase, Recency, Frequency, Monetary) using histograms, boxplots, and density plots to understand their spread.
2. Bivariate Analysis:
+ Explore relationships between variables (e.g., how Recency correlates with Monetary).
+ Use scatter plots and correlation heatmaps to reveal relationships between Recency, Frequency, and Monetary.
3. Customer Demographics:
+ Analyze how customers are distributed across different Countries or Regions.
